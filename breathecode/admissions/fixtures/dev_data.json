The world is divided between servers and clients.\\n2. We call \\\"clients\\\" the computers with browsers or mobile apps.\\n3. We call servers where the centralized database is.\\n\\n### HTTP Request vs Response**\\n\\n- The rules used for this client-sever communication is called HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.\\n- The way that you get the website is by sending a \\\"Request\\\" to the server. This tells the server what website or resource you are looking to view\\/use. The server then responds with the information.\\n- The server then sends a response, which tells will confirm the receipt of the request and let your computer know that it will begin sending data.\\n- This back and forth process will continue with more Request=>Response pairs until you have finished loading your remote resource.\\n\\n### Everything is text!\\n\\n- With HTTP, it\\u2019s important to focus on the first T in the acronym, which stands for `Text`. In this protocol, everything is sent back and forth as TEXT.\\n- While there are other protocols out there, for now, we want to remember that with HTTP \\u2013 Everything is TEXT.\\n- Make students open a picture with Notepad\\/TextEdit they will see the text that represents the image.\\n\\n### Browser Interpretation\\n\\n- After your browser uses the HTTP protocol and receives the data as text, it then has the job of interpreting that text and converting it to the correct visual format.\\n\\n#### HTML\\n\\n- The first TEXT-based format we will see is HTML.\\n- HTML its all about `<tags>` you open and close tags to give them basic format.\\n- There are a lot of HTML tags but you only have to know a few and you can always google them.\\n    - Explain the basic tags like `<p>`,`<div>`,`<a>`,`<span>`, headings (`<h1>`,`<h2>`,etc).\\n\\n[[demo]]\\n| :point_up: The most important thing to remember in HTML is to ALWAYS BE CLOSING!\\n\\n#### Always Be Closing and Indentation Matters**\\n\\n- Everything is going to be done in blocks of code.\\n- First you open the block, then you close the block.\\n\\n### CSS vs HTML\\n```css\\n#id_selector { property: value; }\\n.class_selector { property: value; }\\ntag_selector { property: value; }\\n```\\n\\n## `20 min` Start the new content: Advanced CSS\\n\\n### Specificity\\n\\n- Do not use ID as CSS selectors (use specificity).\\n- The class selector is the most used because it can be reused all over your website.\\n- Show this [video that explains](https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=In78mSOHmls) specificity to the class.\\n- Combine selectors to get more specific about which element you are styling\\n- Ask if anyone remembers what we said DRY Programming means? Don\\u2019t repeat yourself.\\nYou may think it\\u2019s funny that they call the opposite of DRY -  WET programming, which they have given the following titles to:  \\\"write everything twice\\\", \\\"we enjoy typing\\\" or \\\"waste everyone's time\\\"**\\n\\n\\n### Box Model\\n\\n- Box layout means that most elements can be thought of as boxes: with margin, padding, with and height.\\n- There are 4 main parts to the typical box model: (draw the following on the board or show picture from breathcode)\\n    - Content: this is what is inside the box\\n    - Padding: this is spacing between the border and content (inside box also)\\n    - Border: this is the edge of the box\\n    - Margin: this is spacing between the outside of the box and the next element over in any direction. (which could be the edge of the page, another div, a paragraph, or even an image)\\n- You can also have a background color or image, this will show in the content area of your box.\\n\\n#### The Display Property:\\n\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline`: Display block its what makes an element behave like a box, inline elements have no margins.\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n- Display: flex; its the main tool for building complex layouts because it easily allows having several divs on the same line (columns).\\n- I recommend going over the CSS and HTML [cheat sheets that we have available on the breathco.de platform under Assets](https:\\/\\/breatheco.de\\/assets\\/).\\n \\n## Display Flex and how important it is.\\n\\nTake some time to explain display:flex and how it is used on today's project.\\n\\n#### The Position Property:\\n\\n- Position:fixed follows the user, it is mainly used for anoying modals or popups.\\n- If one element has position:relative must always be companioned by one or more childs with position:absolute. Its broadly used for relating two elements to each other (one follows the other)\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n\\n## `2:30 hr` Start the project!\\n\\nRead the instructions out loud with the class, make sure they understand.\\n\\nStudents must start discussing on the whiteboard a strategy about the project.\\n- From top to bottom identify the tags you will be using.\\n- When to use `display:inline-block` and\\/or `position:absolute` or `position:relative`.\\n- Setup the project with one `index.html` and one `styles.css`\\n\\n## `20 min` Bootstrap\\n\\n### What is bootstrap?\\n\\nJust a predefined stylesheet inveted by [a guy at twitter (Mark Otto)](https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/mdo?lang=en).\\n\\n### Why?\\n\\n- Because doing styles is repetitive, it was about time someone did a boilerplate.\\n- Its component oriented.\\n- It makes websites easier and faster to build.\\n\\n### Bootstrap versions & download\\n\\nBootstrap has many versions, always check if you are using the last version of Bootstrap on your project, here you can find all the available versions: [https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/](https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/)\\n\\nWe recomend using a CDN to import bootstrap in your HTML like this one: [https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/](https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/)\\n\\n### The Most Important (Used) Components\\n\\n1. Navbar\\n2. Card\\n3. Modal: https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/4.0\\/components\\/modal\\/#live-demo\\n\\n### The Basic Workflow (asuming you have a wireframe or design)\\n\\n1. Build your basic layout with the Grid (container, row and collumns)\\n1. Identify the components you will need (use piece of paper)\\n2. Copy & Paste the component code into your website.\\n3. Customize the component for your specific design.\\n4. Adjust anything else overriding with css styles on your own sylesheet.\\n5. Remember the utility classes to avoid doing to much custom CSS.\\n\\n### Helper\\/Utility Classes that come with bootstrap*\\n\\nThese are classes you can attach that do things such as control margin or padding, control borders, or even float elements.\\nFor example, if you wanted no margin on the left of the element, you can add the class ml-0 to the element and it will set the left margin to zero.\\n\\n### Layout using Grid system\\n\\n- Explain 12 column layout and how it works\\n- every line is a Row\\n- this row holds columns as immediate childs\\n- every Row on a page has 12 columns\\n- columns are equally measured in percentages so they are responsive.\\n- the basic sizes are: col, col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl\\n\\n### Bootstrap does not have fonts or icons\\n\\nWe use google fonts and font awesome for that.\\n\\n## `2:30min` Have class work on bootstrap instagram.\\n\\n- Students gather in pairs tos strategize first (best practice)\\n- Read instructions out loud and have them build a strategy\\n- Have them identify the components.\\n\\nDo not talk more, they will not be able to process it because they are overwhelmed, just help them code.\\n\\nAnswer questions individually with your teacher assistants.\\n\"},{\"id\":2,\"position\":2,\"label\":\"Making Layouts\",\"key-concepts\":[\"Icons are fonts\",\"Fontawesome library\",\"Using pseudo selectors\",\"Using more specific selectos \",\"Write your styles from the less specific to the most specific\"],\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"Mastering CSS Selectors\",\"slug\":\"mastering-css-selectors\"},{\"title\":\"CSS Layouts: Create and Build Layouts with CSS\",\"slug\":\"css-layouts\"}],\"assignments\":[\"instagram-feed\"],\"replits\":[],\"quizzes\":[],\"teacher_instructions\":\"Focus a lot on the strategy behind the exercise: how to identify the elements on the website by drawing boxes on top of it, make sure they understand the flex property and how to display elements horizontally, show the google inspector and how to inspect your code and be able to identify conflicting styles.

Set of files which make up your snapshot at that time\\n2. Instructions pointing to the Parent commit objects\\n3. An SH1 (hash) name that serves as a unique identifier for that specific commit.\\n4. Commits also typically have comments, which should explain what was changed or addressed in the current commit\\n\\n### The HEAD\\n\\nThe heads of the repository are like the \\\"revision history of the project.\\\"  \\n\\nA revision history is a list of commit objects that altogether contain all the changes that you and your other team members have made to the project files.\\n\\nEvery time you make a new commit, the head will move to that new commit.  (This way you are able to have access to the entire project history of commits.)\\n\\nIt is possible to move the head to a different commit, however, you must remember that commits made after the commit to which the head is pointing at are not possible to be reviewed.\\n\\n### The Stage\\n\\nWhen creating a commit, you select which files you wish to add to the commit. This is called \\\"staging\\\" your commit. (basically, preparing your formal commit object)\\n\\nTypically, you will use \\\"git add .\\\" which adds all files to your stage for the current commit, then follow it with your commit.\\n\\n### Branch\\n\\nA branch allows you to work on a specific feature of code without compromising the main code in a repository.  [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits) \\n\\nThat means that each branch is a separate revision history.\\n\\nThe main branch of code in the repository is called \\\"Master\\\" typically\\n\\nYou can have as many different branches as you want in a repository\\/project.\\n\\nEach branch has it\\u2019s own head which resides on the last commit of that branch. So if you have two branches, \\\"Master\\\" and \\u201clogin\\u201d, each will have their own head on the last commit.\\n\\nWhen you are satisfied with the feature you developed, you can merge it back in to master and it will bring all code changes, along with replace the head on master with the new head.\\n\\n### Typical Flow\\n\\n1. All new projects have to be initialized with git.  (git init)\\n    - This creates a git folder with all elements that define the git project.\\n    - At this point, it\\u2019s also good to set the remote for your project. This will tell the project what the address is for your repository so that you can push changes later.\\n\\n 2. the command for this is:  git remote add origin https:\\/\\/github.com\\/user\\/repo.git \\n\\n 3. where the address at the end is your repository address or SSH address.\\n\\n26. Whenever you have to stage your changes, you use \\\"git add\\\". As mentioned before, to add all file changes, \\u201cgit add .\\u201d \\n\\n > Note: conversely, you can condense this into the git commit by adding a flag \\\"-a\\\" which means add all files to the commit stage\\n\\n4. Once you made changes to your code and you are ready to commit: You create a commit object by using \\\"git commit -m \\u2018commit message\\u2019\\\" or if you have not used git add, you can use the -a flag as mentioned before.\\n\\n5. At this point, you want to use \\u2018git push\\u2019 to upload your changes\\n\\n6. If you need to create a new branch:\\n\\n    - git checkout -b [branch name]\\n\\n    - next you need to switch to that branch to work on it\\n\\n        3. git checkout [branch name]\\n\\n    - when you complete your changes on a new branch, you merge the changes back in using the following:\\n\\n        4. git merge [other branch name]\\n\\n\\n## Commit vs PUSH\\n\\nWe already discussed that a commit will allow you to create a new commit object. This is a local bundle you are preparing to upload.\\n\\nWhen you finish your commit, you have to attempt to upload that code to the repository.\\n\\nThis is where git push comes in. It allows you to attempt to upload your changes to the repository.\\n\\nIf there are any issues where a conflict has arisen, you will have to resolve the conflicts before pushing your changes.\\n\\n## Resolving Conflicts\\n\\nFor conflicts, git will notify you that there are issues.\\n\\n- this typically occurs when two people are trying to modify the same file(s).\\n\\nTo proceed you need to:\\n\\n- Get the new changes downloaded to your computer with \\u2018git pull\\u2019 or if you are on a branch, \\u2018git pull origin branch-name\\u2019\\n\\n- Then you will be asked to merge the changes \\n\\n- Here you will have to edit the files with conflicts and resolve any changes. \\n\\n- Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can attempt to push changes again.\\n\\n## Start Coding With The Students!\\n\\n** At this point we will start the assignment for the git collaborative portfolio project.**\\n\\n** Break the class into groups and assign a section of the portfolio project**\\n\\n** [https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg]**(https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg)\\n\\n* Use peer programming to complete the section quickly, then upload the changes to the repository your professor has provided.\\n\\nTeacher will clone the repo in a new class repository and will handle updating the name of the template parts so that the site functions properly.\\n\\n### Students Homework: \\n\\nFinish all pending projects including todays.\"},{\"id\":8,\"label\":\"Intro to JS\",\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"What is JavaScript?

Students will be overwhelmed.\\n\\n### Why Javascript?\\n\\nStatic websites are just blog posts, but was about interactive applications like Instagram, Facebook, etc.?\\n\\nJavascript lets us create dynamic HTML and CSS based on user or system interactions, for example:\\n- Adding an `li` to a `ul` when the user clicks on a button.\\n- Showing a banner or ad (publicity) based on the user IP address.\\n- Ask for information to a database.\\n- Write on a database using AJAX.\\n- etc.\\n\\nBasically: Javascript its a programming language to generate HTML and CSS (text) based on events.\\n\\n## The`<script>` tag:\\n\\nAll javascript must be done on a separate sheet (best practice).\\nYou have to import to put that tag **right before the body closing tag**.\\nThe code execution starts on the `window.onload = function(){}` like this:\\n```\\n\\/\\/index.js\\n\\nwindow.onload = function(){\\n    \\/\\/your code here\\n}\\n\\n\\/\\/you can declar other functions here, but please don't write code outside functions\\n```\\n\\n**Warning**: Carefull explaining the windown.onload, because today we are not suppose to overwhelme them with events and functions.\\n\\n### Explain Variables:\\n\\nVariables are javascript\\u2019s version of containers that hold some information.\\n\\nAn example of this is:\\n\\n1. Let\\u2019s say we needed to store someone\\u2019s birthday for an age verification script\\n2. One of our variables might be: `var day = 29;`\\n3. There are three things going on here:\\n    - First, the computer interprets the letters VAR as the beginnig of a variable declaration.\\n    - After `VAR` it must always come the variable name: in our case is called `day`.\\n    - Secondly, we are storing a value of 29 in that variable.\\n    - Finally, notice the syntax. All javascript lines typically end with semicolon. There will be some cases where you don\\u2019t use semicolon and we will learn those later but for now, all lines are with semicolon.\\n\\n3. Given that we defined the var above, `var day = 29;` if we want to display it for testing, we can show use the javascript console:\\n    - Explain how to open the google inspector console\\n    - So to display the variable, you would use: `console.log(day);`\\n    - will print on the console `29`\\n\\n### Data Types\\n\\nYou can store 6 differnt types of values: Strings, Integers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects, Functions, Null and Undefined.\\n\\n- Boolean - true\\/false\\n- String - always in quotes\\n- Number - any type of number -  integer numbers, negative numbers, decimal numbers, floats, etc.\\n- Undefined - nothing was set or specified for the variable. so the variable has no value\\n- Null - When a database or function returns nothing, it returns null\\n- Array - data sets [2,3,4,\\\"cat\\\",242,\\\"d\\\"]\\n- Object - You can explain objects like real life objects that are comprised by other datatypes, you can use the analogy with HTML Tags because the tags have properties taht describe them further. Objects behave the same way.\\n\\nNote: Data Types on Breatheco.de: [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types)\\n\\n### String Contatenation\\n\\nSuming two integers its not the same as suming two strings, as web developers we are going to be creating HTML using Javascript, we will contatenate like crazy!\\n\\n### Arrays (no loops yet)\\n\\nSince we just learned what an array is, let\\u2019s look at some basic properties of an array:\\n\\n1. value or item: The value stored on each position.\\n2. index or position: the position of the given value in the array `note: the first position starts at 0`\\n3. length - the total length of the array\\n\\nDeclaring an array [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array#how-to-declare-an-array)\\n\\nTo initialize an array , you can use the following:\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [];\\n```\\nThis defines the array as an empty set so that you can add values later.\\n\\nNote: Don\\u2019t use, use let or const.\\n\\nYou can also initialize an array with a value in it**\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];\\n```\\nDisplaying the value of an array using console, we can show it as `console.log(myArray[0]);`\\n\\nUpdating a specific position: `myArray[4]=3;`\\n\\nGenerating a random number using `Math.rand()`\\n\\n## Start Coding!!

Instead of re-rendering the whole page when a single change occurs, React renders individual items that change. \\n\\n#### You can create your own tags\\n\\n- Before, you learned that HTML Tags are set functions that the browser knows how to interpret.\\n- Now in React, You can create your own tags by creating usable components.\\n- Just create a function that returns HTML and that will become its own tag.\\n- JSX its like HTML+JS you have to get use to it.\\n- You have to use braces in the middle of your HTML to include dynamic JS.\\n```jsx\\nconst Alert = function(props){\\n    return (<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>);\\n}\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>)\\n```\\n- You have to use [proptypes](https:\\/\\/reactjs.org\\/docs\\/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (best practice).\\n```js\\nAlert.propTypes = {\\n  children: PropTypes.node,\\n  \\/\\/ any other property...\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## `1:25 min` Do the React Exercises with the students\\n\\nThe transition to react its hard for the students, that is why we will be doing the react exercises with them.\\n\\n## `60 min before class ends` Start the class project (Landing Page)\\n\\n- This project will be do in groups of two. \\n- Every team must share the same git repository.\\n- Take some time to read the instructions with the students and have them setup they boilerplate and repository.\\n- Each group will strategize privatly how to approach the exercise.\"},{\"id\":20,\"label\":\"Landing Page with React\",\"lessons\":[],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Landing Page with React\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/landing-page-with-react\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"\",\"position\":19,\"assignments\":[\"landing-page-with-react\"],\"description\":\"Time to build your first website using the most popular front-end framework in the world: React.js\",\"key-concepts\":[],\"teacher_instructions\":\"Review the react.js concepts again and have students identify the bootstrap components being used on the landing page, then they have to actually build those components as react components.\"},{\"id\":21,\"label\":\"Simple Counter\",\"lessons\":[],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Simple Counter\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/simple-counter-react\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"Students must work on their simple counter.\",\"position\":20,\"assignments\":[\"simple-counter-react\"],\"description\":\"Its the first time you've heard or learn about react, we have given you a lot of exercises to practice.

The world is divided between servers and clients.\\n2. We call \\\"clients\\\" the computers with browsers or mobile apps.\\n3. We call servers where the centralized database is.\\n\\n### HTTP Request vs Response**\\n\\n- The rules used for this client-sever communication is called HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.\\n- The way that you get the website is by sending a \\\"Request\\\" to the server. This tells the server what website or resource you are looking to view\\/use. The server then responds with the information.\\n- The server then sends a response, which tells will confirm the receipt of the request and let your computer know that it will begin sending data.\\n- This back and forth process will continue with more Request=>Response pairs until you have finished loading your remote resource.\\n\\n### Everything is text!\\n\\n- With HTTP, it\\u2019s important to focus on the first T in the acronym, which stands for `Text`. In this protocol, everything is sent back and forth as TEXT.\\n- While there are other protocols out there, for now, we want to remember that with HTTP \\u2013 Everything is TEXT.\\n- Make students open a picture with Notepad\\/TextEdit they will see the text that represents the image.\\n\\n### Browser Interpretation\\n\\n- After your browser uses the HTTP protocol and receives the data as text, it then has the job of interpreting that text and converting it to the correct visual format.\\n\\n#### HTML\\n\\n- The first TEXT-based format we will see is HTML.\\n- HTML its all about `<tags>` you open and close tags to give them basic format.\\n- There are a lot of HTML tags but you only have to know a few and you can always google them.\\n    - Explain the basic tags like `<p>`,`<div>`,`<a>`,`<span>`, headings (`<h1>`,`<h2>`,etc).\\n\\n[[demo]]\\n| :point_up: The most important thing to remember in HTML is to ALWAYS BE CLOSING!\\n\\n#### Always Be Closing and Indentation Matters**\\n\\n- Everything is going to be done in blocks of code.\\n- First you open the block, then you close the block.\\n\\n### CSS vs HTML\\n```css\\n#id_selector { property: value; }\\n.class_selector { property: value; }\\ntag_selector { property: value; }\\n```\\n\\n## `20 min` Start the new content: Advanced CSS\\n\\n### Specificity\\n\\n- Do not use ID as CSS selectors (use specificity).\\n- The class selector is the most used because it can be reused all over your website.\\n- Show this [video that explains](https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=In78mSOHmls) specificity to the class.\\n- Combine selectors to get more specific about which element you are styling\\n- Ask if anyone remembers what we said DRY Programming means? Don\\u2019t repeat yourself.\\nYou may think it\\u2019s funny that they call the opposite of DRY -  WET programming, which they have given the following titles to:  \\\"write everything twice\\\", \\\"we enjoy typing\\\" or \\\"waste everyone's time\\\"**\\n\\n\\n### Box Model\\n\\n- Box layout means that most elements can be thought of as boxes: with margin, padding, with and height.\\n- There are 4 main parts to the typical box model: (draw the following on the board or show picture from breathcode)\\n    - Content: this is what is inside the box\\n    - Padding: this is spacing between the border and content (inside box also)\\n    - Border: this is the edge of the box\\n    - Margin: this is spacing between the outside of the box and the next element over in any direction. (which could be the edge of the page, another div, a paragraph, or even an image)\\n- You can also have a background color or image, this will show in the content area of your box.\\n\\n#### The Display Property:\\n\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline`: Display block its what makes an element behave like a box, inline elements have no margins.\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n- Display: flex; its the main tool for building complex layouts because it easily allows having several divs on the same line (columns).\\n- I recommend going over the CSS and HTML [cheat sheets that we have available on the breathco.de platform under Assets](https:\\/\\/breatheco.de\\/assets\\/).\\n \\n## Display Flex and how important it is.\\n\\nTake some time to explain display:flex and how it is used on today's project.\\n\\n#### The Position Property:\\n\\n- Position:fixed follows the user, it is mainly used for anoying modals or popups.\\n- If one element has position:relative must always be companioned by one or more childs with position:absolute. Its broadly used for relating two elements to each other (one follows the other)\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n\\n## `2:30 hr` Start the project!\\n\\nRead the instructions out loud with the class, make sure they understand.\\n\\nStudents must start discussing on the whiteboard a strategy about the project.\\n- From top to bottom identify the tags you will be using.\\n- When to use `display:inline-block` and\\/or `position:absolute` or `position:relative`.\\n- Setup the project with one `index.html` and one `styles.css`\\n\\n## `20 min` Bootstrap\\n\\n### What is bootstrap?\\n\\nJust a predefined stylesheet inveted by [a guy at twitter (Mark Otto)](https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/mdo?lang=en).\\n\\n### Why?\\n\\n- Because doing styles is repetitive, it was about time someone did a boilerplate.\\n- Its component oriented.\\n- It makes websites easier and faster to build.\\n\\n### Bootstrap versions & download\\n\\nBootstrap has many versions, always check if you are using the last version of Bootstrap on your project, here you can find all the available versions: [https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/](https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/)\\n\\nWe recomend using a CDN to import bootstrap in your HTML like this one: [https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/](https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/)\\n\\n### The Most Important (Used) Components\\n\\n1. Navbar\\n2. Card\\n3. Modal: https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/4.0\\/components\\/modal\\/#live-demo\\n\\n### The Basic Workflow (asuming you have a wireframe or design)\\n\\n1. Build your basic layout with the Grid (container, row and collumns)\\n1. Identify the components you will need (use piece of paper)\\n2. Copy & Paste the component code into your website.\\n3. Customize the component for your specific design.\\n4. Adjust anything else overriding with css styles on your own sylesheet.\\n5. Remember the utility classes to avoid doing to much custom CSS.\\n\\n### Helper\\/Utility Classes that come with bootstrap*\\n\\nThese are classes you can attach that do things such as control margin or padding, control borders, or even float elements.\\nFor example, if you wanted no margin on the left of the element, you can add the class ml-0 to the element and it will set the left margin to zero.\\n\\n### Layout using Grid system\\n\\n- Explain 12 column layout and how it works\\n- every line is a Row\\n- this row holds columns as immediate childs\\n- every Row on a page has 12 columns\\n- columns are equally measured in percentages so they are responsive.\\n- the basic sizes are: col, col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl\\n\\n### Bootstrap does not have fonts or icons\\n\\nWe use google fonts and font awesome for that.\\n\\n## `2:30min` Have class work on bootstrap instagram.\\n\\n- Students gather in pairs tos strategize first (best practice)\\n- Read instructions out loud and have them build a strategy\\n- Have them identify the components.\\n\\nDo not talk more, they will not be able to process it because they are overwhelmed, just help them code.\\n\\nAnswer questions individually with your teacher assistants.\\n\"},{\"id\":2,\"label\":\"Command Line Challenge\",\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"The Command Line (a.k.a: The Terminal) \",\"slug\":\"the-command-line-the-terminal\"}],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Command Line Challenge\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/exercise-terminal-challenge\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[{\"title\":\"Command line exercises\",\"slug\":\"command-line-exercises\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/cmdchallenge.com\\/\"}],\"homework\":\"Students must remember to read the next lesson before next class.\",\"position\":2,\"assignments\":[{\"slug\":\"exercise-terminal-challenge\",\"title\":\"Command Line Challenge\"}],\"description\":\"A text editor and the console - that's all you need to be a great coder.

Set of files which make up your snapshot at that time\\n2. Instructions pointing to the Parent commit objects\\n3. An SH1 (hash) name that serves as a unique identifier for that specific commit.\\n4. Commits also typically have comments, which should explain what was changed or addressed in the current commit\\n\\n### The HEAD\\n\\nThe heads of the repository are like the \\\"revision history of the project.\\\"  \\n\\nA revision history is a list of commit objects that altogether contain all the changes that you and your other team members have made to the project files.\\n\\nEvery time you make a new commit, the head will move to that new commit.  (This way you are able to have access to the entire project history of commits.)\\n\\nIt is possible to move the head to a different commit, however, you must remember that commits made after the commit to which the head is pointing at are not possible to be reviewed.\\n\\n### The Stage\\n\\nWhen creating a commit, you select which files you wish to add to the commit. This is called \\\"staging\\\" your commit. (basically, preparing your formal commit object)\\n\\nTypically, you will use \\\"git add .\\\" which adds all files to your stage for the current commit, then follow it with your commit.\\n\\n### Branch\\n\\nA branch allows you to work on a specific feature of code without compromising the main code in a repository.  [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits) \\n\\nThat means that each branch is a separate revision history.\\n\\nThe main branch of code in the repository is called \\\"Master\\\" typically\\n\\nYou can have as many different branches as you want in a repository\\/project.\\n\\nEach branch has it\\u2019s own head which resides on the last commit of that branch. So if you have two branches, \\\"Master\\\" and \\u201clogin\\u201d, each will have their own head on the last commit.\\n\\nWhen you are satisfied with the feature you developed, you can merge it back in to master and it will bring all code changes, along with replace the head on master with the new head.\\n\\n### Typical Flow\\n\\n1. All new projects have to be initialized with git.  (git init)\\n    - This creates a git folder with all elements that define the git project.\\n    - At this point, it\\u2019s also good to set the remote for your project. This will tell the project what the address is for your repository so that you can push changes later.\\n\\n 2. the command for this is:  git remote add origin https:\\/\\/github.com\\/user\\/repo.git \\n\\n 3. where the address at the end is your repository address or SSH address.\\n\\n26. Whenever you have to stage your changes, you use \\\"git add\\\". As mentioned before, to add all file changes, \\u201cgit add .\\u201d \\n\\n > Note: conversely, you can condense this into the git commit by adding a flag \\\"-a\\\" which means add all files to the commit stage\\n\\n4. Once you made changes to your code and you are ready to commit: You create a commit object by using \\\"git commit -m \\u2018commit message\\u2019\\\" or if you have not used git add, you can use the -a flag as mentioned before.\\n\\n5. At this point, you want to use \\u2018git push\\u2019 to upload your changes\\n\\n6. If you need to create a new branch:\\n\\n    - git checkout -b [branch name]\\n\\n    - next you need to switch to that branch to work on it\\n\\n        3. git checkout [branch name]\\n\\n    - when you complete your changes on a new branch, you merge the changes back in using the following:\\n\\n        4. git merge [other branch name]\\n\\n\\n## Commit vs PUSH\\n\\nWe already discussed that a commit will allow you to create a new commit object. This is a local bundle you are preparing to upload.\\n\\nWhen you finish your commit, you have to attempt to upload that code to the repository.\\n\\nThis is where git push comes in. It allows you to attempt to upload your changes to the repository.\\n\\nIf there are any issues where a conflict has arisen, you will have to resolve the conflicts before pushing your changes.\\n\\n## Resolving Conflicts\\n\\nFor conflicts, git will notify you that there are issues.\\n\\n- this typically occurs when two people are trying to modify the same file(s).\\n\\nTo proceed you need to:\\n\\n- Get the new changes downloaded to your computer with \\u2018git pull\\u2019 or if you are on a branch, \\u2018git pull origin branch-name\\u2019\\n\\n- Then you will be asked to merge the changes \\n\\n- Here you will have to edit the files with conflicts and resolve any changes. \\n\\n- Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can attempt to push changes again.\\n\\n## Start Coding With The Students!\\n\\n** At this point we will start the assignment for the git collaborative portfolio project.**\\n\\n** Break the class into groups and assign a section of the portfolio project**\\n\\n** [https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg]**(https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg)\\n\\n* Use peer programming to complete the section quickly, then upload the changes to the repository your professor has provided.\\n\\nTeacher will clone the repo in a new class repository and will handle updating the name of the template parts so that the site functions properly.\\n\\n### Students Homework: \\n\\nFinish all pending projects including todays.\"},{\"id\":5,\"label\":\"Excuse Generator\",\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"What is JavaScript?

Students will be overwhelmed.\\n\\n### Why Javascript?\\n\\nStatic websites are just blog posts, but was about interactive applications like Instagram, Facebook, etc.?\\n\\nJavascript lets us create dynamic HTML and CSS based on user or system interactions, for example:\\n- Adding an `li` to a `ul` when the user clicks on a button.\\n- Showing a banner or ad (publicity) based on the user IP address.\\n- Ask for information to a database.\\n- Write on a database using AJAX.\\n- etc.\\n\\nBasically: Javascript its a programming language to generate HTML and CSS (text) based on events.\\n\\n## The`<script>` tag:\\n\\nAll javascript must be done on a separate sheet (best practice).\\nYou have to import to put that tag **right before the body closing tag**.\\nThe code execution starts on the `window.onload = function(){}` like this:\\n```\\n\\/\\/index.js\\n\\nwindow.onload = function(){\\n    \\/\\/your code here\\n}\\n\\n\\/\\/you can declar other functions here, but please don't write code outside functions\\n```\\n\\n**Warning**: Carefull explaining the windown.onload, because today we are not suppose to overwhelme them with events and functions.\\n\\n### Explain Variables:\\n\\nVariables are javascript\\u2019s version of containers that hold some information.\\n\\nAn example of this is:\\n\\n1. Let\\u2019s say we needed to store someone\\u2019s birthday for an age verification script\\n2. One of our variables might be: `var day = 29;`\\n3. There are three things going on here:\\n    - First, the computer interprets the letters VAR as the beginnig of a variable declaration.\\n    - After `VAR` it must always come the variable name: in our case is called `day`.\\n    - Secondly, we are storing a value of 29 in that variable.\\n    - Finally, notice the syntax. All javascript lines typically end with semicolon. There will be some cases where you don\\u2019t use semicolon and we will learn those later but for now, all lines are with semicolon.\\n\\n3. Given that we defined the var above, `var day = 29;` if we want to display it for testing, we can show use the javascript console:\\n    - Explain how to open the google inspector console\\n    - So to display the variable, you would use: `console.log(day);`\\n    - will print on the console `29`\\n\\n### Data Types\\n\\nYou can store 6 differnt types of values: Strings, Integers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects, Functions, Null and Undefined.\\n\\n- Boolean - true\\/false\\n- String - always in quotes\\n- Number - any type of number -  integer numbers, negative numbers, decimal numbers, floats, etc.\\n- Undefined - nothing was set or specified for the variable. so the variable has no value\\n- Null - When a database or function returns nothing, it returns null\\n- Array - data sets [2,3,4,\\\"cat\\\",242,\\\"d\\\"]\\n- Object - You can explain objects like real life objects that are comprised by other datatypes, you can use the analogy with HTML Tags because the tags have properties taht describe them further. Objects behave the same way.\\n\\nNote: Data Types on Breatheco.de: [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types)\\n\\n### String Contatenation\\n\\nSuming two integers its not the same as suming two strings, as web developers we are going to be creating HTML using Javascript, we will contatenate like crazy!\\n\\n### Arrays\\n\\nSince we just learned what an array is, let\\u2019s look at some basic properties of an array:\\n\\n1. value or item: The value stored on each position.\\n2. index or position: the position of the given value in the array `note: the first position starts at 0`\\n3. length - the total length of the array\\n\\nDeclaring an array [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array#how-to-declare-an-array)\\n\\nTo initialize an array , you can use the following:\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [];\\n```\\nThis defines the array as an empty set so that you can add values later.\\n\\nNote: Don\\u2019t use, use let or const.\\n\\nYou can also initialize an array with a value in it**\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];\\n```\\nDisplaying the value of an array using console, we can show it as `console.log(myArray[0]);`\\n\\nUpdating a specific position: `myArray[4]=3;`\\n\\nGenerating a random number using `Math.rand()`\\n\\n## Start Coding!! Let\\u2019s work on the Excuse Generator\\n\\n- Read the instructions with the students, and introduce the problem: How can we create a excuse? What are the pieces that we need to build?\\n- Students MUST discuss with each other how to approach the problem of creating an excuse, guide them.\\n- The project does not have to be fully finished at the end of the class, some students are slower than others, but at  least tgey should be half way and with a clear idea.\\n- To include the excuse into the document you can tell them tu use `document.querySelector('body').innerHTML = excuse;` but don't try to explain the DOM, that is for another class and they are already overwhelmed.\\n\"},{\"id\":6,\"label\":\"Practice JS\",\"lessons\":[],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Code an Excuse Generator in Javascript\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/excuse-generator\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[{\"title\":\"Practice Javascript Functions Tutorial\",\"slug\":\"javascript-functions-exercises-tutorial\"}],\"homework\":\"\",\"position\":6,\"assignments\":[{\"slug\":\"excuse-generator\",\"title\":\"Code an Excuse Generator in Javascript\"}],\"description\":\"The only way to master coding is thru practice, today we'll show you how practice must be done, and we hope you continue practicing on your own time.\",\"key-concepts\":[\"how gitpod exercises work\",\"how important it is to practice\",\"how to work with strings\",\"how to work with functions\",\"how to work with arrays\"],\"teacher_instructions\":\"Coding Practice Day: Students take turns on the screen, one at a time, one student share the screen and tries completing the exercise, and the others help, every student must go around at least two times.

React handles all of that. You will create your own components and tell react what component to render and when; react handles all interaction with DOM on the front end.\\n- Now its all about component based, its a lot easier to re-use your code int he future.\\n- It\\u2019s much faster than traditional javascript. Instead of re-rendering the whole page when a single change occurs, React renders individual items that change. \\n\\n#### You can create your own tags\\n\\n- Before, you learned that HTML Tags are set functions that the browser knows how to interpret.\\n- Now in React, You can create your own tags by creating usable components.\\n- Just create a function that returns HTML and that will become its own tag.\\n- JSX its like HTML+JS you have to get use to it.\\n- You have to use braces in the middle of your HTML to include dynamic JS.\\n```jsx\\nconst Alert = function(props){\\n    return (<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>);\\n}\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>)\\n```\\n- You have to use [proptypes](https:\\/\\/reactjs.org\\/docs\\/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (best practice).\\n```js\\nAlert.propTypes = {\\n  children: PropTypes.node,\\n  \\/\\/ any other property...\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## `1:25 min` Do the React Exercises with the students\\n\\nThe transition to react its hard for the students, that is why we will be doing the react exercises with them.\\n\\n## `60 min before class ends` Start the class project (Landing Page)\\n\\n- This project will be do in groups of two. \\n- Every team must share the same git repository.\\n- Take some time to read the instructions with the students and have them setup they boilerplate and repository.\\n- Each group will strategize privatly how to approach the exercise.\"},{\"id\":14,\"label\":\"Simple Counter\",\"lessons\":[],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Simple Counter\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/simple-counter-react\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"Students must work on their simple counter.\",\"position\":14,\"assignments\":[{\"slug\":\"simple-counter-react\",\"title\":\"Simple Counter\"}],\"description\":\"Its the first time you've heard or learn about react, we have given you a lot of exercises to practice.

The world is divided between servers and clients.\\n2. We call \\\"clients\\\" the computers with browsers or mobile apps.\\n3. We call servers where the centralized database is.\\n\\n### HTTP Request vs Response**\\n\\n- The rules used for this client-sever communication is called HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.\\n- The way that you get the website is by sending a \\\"Request\\\" to the server. This tells the server what website or resource you are looking to view\\/use. The server then responds with the information.\\n- The server then sends a response, which tells will confirm the receipt of the request and let your computer know that it will begin sending data.\\n- This back and forth process will continue with more Request=>Response pairs until you have finished loading your remote resource.\\n\\n### Everything is text!\\n\\n- With HTTP, it\\u2019s important to focus on the first T in the acronym, which stands for `Text`. In this protocol, everything is sent back and forth as TEXT.\\n- While there are other protocols out there, for now, we want to remember that with HTTP \\u2013 Everything is TEXT.\\n- Make students open a picture with Notepad\\/TextEdit they will see the text that represents the image.\\n\\n### Browser Interpretation\\n\\n- After your browser uses the HTTP protocol and receives the data as text, it then has the job of interpreting that text and converting it to the correct visual format.\\n\\n#### HTML\\n\\n- The first TEXT-based format we will see is HTML.\\n- HTML its all about `<tags>` you open and close tags to give them basic format.\\n- There are a lot of HTML tags but you only have to know a few and you can always google them.\\n    - Explain the basic tags like `<p>`,`<div>`,`<a>`,`<span>`, headings (`<h1>`,`<h2>`,etc).\\n\\n[[demo]]\\n| :point_up: The most important thing to remember in HTML is to ALWAYS BE CLOSING!\\n\\n#### Always Be Closing and Indentation Matters**\\n\\n- Everything is going to be done in blocks of code.\\n- First you open the block, then you close the block.\\n\\n### CSS vs HTML\\n```css\\n#id_selector { property: value; }\\n.class_selector { property: value; }\\ntag_selector { property: value; }\\n```\\n\\n## `20 min` Start the new content: Advanced CSS\\n\\n### Specificity\\n\\n- Do not use ID as CSS selectors (use specificity).\\n- The class selector is the most used because it can be reused all over your website.\\n- Show this [video that explains](https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=In78mSOHmls) specificity to the class.\\n- Combine selectors to get more specific about which element you are styling\\n- Ask if anyone remembers what we said DRY Programming means? Don\\u2019t repeat yourself.\\nYou may think it\\u2019s funny that they call the opposite of DRY -  WET programming, which they have given the following titles to:  \\\"write everything twice\\\", \\\"we enjoy typing\\\" or \\\"waste everyone's time\\\"**\\n\\n\\n### Box Model\\n\\n- Box layout means that most elements can be thought of as boxes: with margin, padding, with and height.\\n- There are 4 main parts to the typical box model: (draw the following on the board or show picture from breathcode)\\n    - Content: this is what is inside the box\\n    - Padding: this is spacing between the border and content (inside box also)\\n    - Border: this is the edge of the box\\n    - Margin: this is spacing between the outside of the box and the next element over in any direction. (which could be the edge of the page, another div, a paragraph, or even an image)\\n- You can also have a background color or image, this will show in the content area of your box.\\n\\n#### The Display Property:\\n\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline`: Display block its what makes an element behave like a box, inline elements have no margins.\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n- Display: flex; its the main tool for building complex layouts because it easily allows having several divs on the same line (columns).\\n- I recommend going over the CSS and HTML [cheat sheets that we have available on the breathco.de platform under Assets](https:\\/\\/breatheco.de\\/assets\\/).\\n \\n## Display Flex and how important it is.\\n\\nTake some time to explain display:flex and how it is used on today's project.\\n\\n#### The Position Property:\\n\\n- Position:fixed follows the user, it is mainly used for anoying modals or popups.\\n- If one element has position:relative must always be companioned by one or more childs with position:absolute. Its broadly used for relating two elements to each other (one follows the other)\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n\\n## `2:30 hr` Start the project!\\n\\nRead the instructions out loud with the class, make sure they understand.\\n\\nStudents must start discussing on the whiteboard a strategy about the project.\\n- From top to bottom identify the tags you will be using.\\n- When to use `display:inline-block` and\\/or `position:absolute` or `position:relative`.\\n- Setup the project with one `index.html` and one `styles.css`\\n\\n## `20 min` Bootstrap\\n\\n### What is bootstrap?\\n\\nJust a predefined stylesheet inveted by [a guy at twitter (Mark Otto)](https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/mdo?lang=en).\\n\\n### Why?\\n\\n- Because doing styles is repetitive, it was about time someone did a boilerplate.\\n- Its component oriented.\\n- It makes websites easier and faster to build.\\n\\n### Bootstrap versions & download\\n\\nBootstrap has many versions, always check if you are using the last version of Bootstrap on your project, here you can find all the available versions: [https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/](https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/)\\n\\nWe recomend using a CDN to import bootstrap in your HTML like this one: [https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/](https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/)\\n\\n### The Most Important (Used) Components\\n\\n1. Navbar\\n2. Card\\n3. Modal: https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/4.0\\/components\\/modal\\/#live-demo\\n\\n### The Basic Workflow (asuming you have a wireframe or design)\\n\\n1. Build your basic layout with the Grid (container, row and collumns)\\n1. Identify the components you will need (use piece of paper)\\n2. Copy & Paste the component code into your website.\\n3. Customize the component for your specific design.\\n4. Adjust anything else overriding with css styles on your own sylesheet.\\n5. Remember the utility classes to avoid doing to much custom CSS.\\n\\n### Helper\\/Utility Classes that come with bootstrap*\\n\\nThese are classes you can attach that do things such as control margin or padding, control borders, or even float elements.\\nFor example, if you wanted no margin on the left of the element, you can add the class ml-0 to the element and it will set the left margin to zero.\\n\\n### Layout using Grid system\\n\\n- Explain 12 column layout and how it works\\n- every line is a Row\\n- this row holds columns as immediate childs\\n- every Row on a page has 12 columns\\n- columns are equally measured in percentages so they are responsive.\\n- the basic sizes are: col, col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl\\n\\n### Bootstrap does not have fonts or icons\\n\\nWe use google fonts and font awesome for that.\\n\\n## `2:30min` Have class work on bootstrap instagram.\\n\\n- Students gather in pairs tos strategize first (best practice)\\n- Read instructions out loud and have them build a strategy\\n- Have them identify the components.\\n\\nDo not talk more, they will not be able to process it because they are overwhelmed, just help them code.\\n\\nAnswer questions individually with your teacher assistants.\\n\"},{\"id\":2,\"label\":\"HTML Forms\",\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"Understanding HTML Input HTML Text Area and Forms...\",\"slug\":\"html-input-html-textarea\"}],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Create a HTML5 form\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/html5-form\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"\",\"position\":2,\"assignments\":[\"html5-form\"],\"description\":\"Forms are the main way to receive inputs from the website user, we use forms every day, and it's worth giving them a whole day focus to understand them properly.\",\"key-concepts\":[\"Forms are the main way to receive data (inputs) from the user\",\"What are form validations\",\"Using max and min on inputs\",\"Using input type=date for dates\",\"Using type=number for numbers\",\"The select (a.k.a dropdown)\",\"Textareas\",\"Radios and checkboxes\",\"Styling a form\"],\"teacher_instructions\":\"Go over forms and why to use them, explain each type of input available and how HTML5 introduced a way to prevent errors using properties like max, min, required,etc. Also focus on how bootstrap allows styling forms and show the bootstrap documentation on forms.\",\"extended_instructions\":\"# HTML Forms\\n\\n## `20 min` About forms\\n\\nThese are the most important things to mention:\\n\\n- Forms are the most important way to receive or ask information to the user.\\n- By default, submitting a form will create a GET or POST request to the server in HTTP, you can specify that on the `<form method=\\\"POST\\\" \\/>` attribute.\\n- GET is for  searching or fetching for information, basically forms that will not result in database update.\\n- POST is for forms that result in database modifications (writing on the db).\\n- What are the most used form elements?

Set of files which make up your snapshot at that time\\n2. Instructions pointing to the Parent commit objects\\n3. An SH1 (hash) name that serves as a unique identifier for that specific commit.\\n4. Commits also typically have comments, which should explain what was changed or addressed in the current commit\\n\\n### The HEAD\\n\\nThe heads of the repository are like the \\\"revision history of the project.\\\"  \\n\\nA revision history is a list of commit objects that altogether contain all the changes that you and your other team members have made to the project files.\\n\\nEvery time you make a new commit, the head will move to that new commit.  (This way you are able to have access to the entire project history of commits.)\\n\\nIt is possible to move the head to a different commit, however, you must remember that commits made after the commit to which the head is pointing at are not possible to be reviewed.\\n\\n### The Stage\\n\\nWhen creating a commit, you select which files you wish to add to the commit. This is called \\\"staging\\\" your commit. (basically, preparing your formal commit object)\\n\\nTypically, you will use \\\"git add .\\\" which adds all files to your stage for the current commit, then follow it with your commit.\\n\\n### Branch\\n\\nA branch allows you to work on a specific feature of code without compromising the main code in a repository.  [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits) \\n\\nThat means that each branch is a separate revision history.\\n\\nThe main branch of code in the repository is called \\\"Master\\\" typically\\n\\nYou can have as many different branches as you want in a repository\\/project.\\n\\nEach branch has it\\u2019s own head which resides on the last commit of that branch. So if you have two branches, \\\"Master\\\" and \\u201clogin\\u201d, each will have their own head on the last commit.\\n\\nWhen you are satisfied with the feature you developed, you can merge it back in to master and it will bring all code changes, along with replace the head on master with the new head.\\n\\n### Typical Flow\\n\\n1. All new projects have to be initialized with git.  (git init)\\n    - This creates a git folder with all elements that define the git project.\\n    - At this point, it\\u2019s also good to set the remote for your project. This will tell the project what the address is for your repository so that you can push changes later.\\n\\n 2. the command for this is:  git remote add origin https:\\/\\/github.com\\/user\\/repo.git \\n\\n 3. where the address at the end is your repository address or SSH address.\\n\\n26. Whenever you have to stage your changes, you use \\\"git add\\\". As mentioned before, to add all file changes, \\u201cgit add .\\u201d \\n\\n > Note: conversely, you can condense this into the git commit by adding a flag \\\"-a\\\" which means add all files to the commit stage\\n\\n4. Once you made changes to your code and you are ready to commit: You create a commit object by using \\\"git commit -m \\u2018commit message\\u2019\\\" or if you have not used git add, you can use the -a flag as mentioned before.\\n\\n5. At this point, you want to use \\u2018git push\\u2019 to upload your changes\\n\\n6. If you need to create a new branch:\\n\\n    - git checkout -b [branch name]\\n\\n    - next you need to switch to that branch to work on it\\n\\n        3. git checkout [branch name]\\n\\n    - when you complete your changes on a new branch, you merge the changes back in using the following:\\n\\n        4. git merge [other branch name]\\n\\n\\n## Commit vs PUSH\\n\\nWe already discussed that a commit will allow you to create a new commit object. This is a local bundle you are preparing to upload.\\n\\nWhen you finish your commit, you have to attempt to upload that code to the repository.\\n\\nThis is where git push comes in. It allows you to attempt to upload your changes to the repository.\\n\\nIf there are any issues where a conflict has arisen, you will have to resolve the conflicts before pushing your changes.\\n\\n## Resolving Conflicts\\n\\nFor conflicts, git will notify you that there are issues.\\n\\n- this typically occurs when two people are trying to modify the same file(s).\\n\\nTo proceed you need to:\\n\\n- Get the new changes downloaded to your computer with \\u2018git pull\\u2019 or if you are on a branch, \\u2018git pull origin branch-name\\u2019\\n\\n- Then you will be asked to merge the changes \\n\\n- Here you will have to edit the files with conflicts and resolve any changes. \\n\\n- Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can attempt to push changes again.\\n\\n## Start Coding With The Students!\\n\\n** At this point we will start the assignment for the git collaborative portfolio project.**\\n\\n** Break the class into groups and assign a section of the portfolio project**\\n\\n** [https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg]**(https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg)\\n\\n* Use peer programming to complete the section quickly, then upload the changes to the repository your professor has provided.\\n\\nTeacher will clone the repo in a new class repository and will handle updating the name of the template parts so that the site functions properly.\\n\\n### Students Homework: \\n\\nFinish all pending projects including todays.\"},{\"id\":6,\"label\":\"Intro to JS\",\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"What is JavaScript?

Students will be overwhelmed.\\n\\n### Why Javascript?\\n\\nStatic websites are just blog posts, but was about interactive applications like Instagram, Facebook, etc.?\\n\\nJavascript lets us create dynamic HTML and CSS based on user or system interactions, for example:\\n- Adding an `li` to a `ul` when the user clicks on a button.\\n- Showing a banner or ad (publicity) based on the user IP address.\\n- Ask for information to a database.\\n- Write on a database using AJAX.\\n- etc.\\n\\nBasically: Javascript its a programming language to generate HTML and CSS (text) based on events.\\n\\n## The`<script>` tag:\\n\\nAll javascript must be done on a separate sheet (best practice).\\nYou have to import to put that tag **right before the body closing tag**.\\nThe code execution starts on the `window.onload = function(){}` like this:\\n```\\n\\/\\/index.js\\n\\nwindow.onload = function(){\\n    \\/\\/your code here\\n}\\n\\n\\/\\/you can declar other functions here, but please don't write code outside functions\\n```\\n\\n**Warning**: Carefull explaining the windown.onload, because today we are not suppose to overwhelme them with events and functions.\\n\\n### Explain Variables:\\n\\nVariables are javascript\\u2019s version of containers that hold some information.\\n\\nAn example of this is:\\n\\n1. Let\\u2019s say we needed to store someone\\u2019s birthday for an age verification script\\n2. One of our variables might be: `var day = 29;`\\n3. There are three things going on here:\\n    - First, the computer interprets the letters VAR as the beginnig of a variable declaration.\\n    - After `VAR` it must always come the variable name: in our case is called `day`.\\n    - Secondly, we are storing a value of 29 in that variable.\\n    - Finally, notice the syntax. All javascript lines typically end with semicolon. There will be some cases where you don\\u2019t use semicolon and we will learn those later but for now, all lines are with semicolon.\\n\\n3. Given that we defined the var above, `var day = 29;` if we want to display it for testing, we can show use the javascript console:\\n    - Explain how to open the google inspector console\\n    - So to display the variable, you would use: `console.log(day);`\\n    - will print on the console `29`\\n\\n### Data Types\\n\\nYou can store 6 differnt types of values: Strings, Integers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects, Functions, Null and Undefined.\\n\\n- Boolean - true\\/false\\n- String - always in quotes\\n- Number - any type of number -  integer numbers, negative numbers, decimal numbers, floats, etc.\\n- Undefined - nothing was set or specified for the variable. so the variable has no value\\n- Null - When a database or function returns nothing, it returns null\\n- Array - data sets [2,3,4,\\\"cat\\\",242,\\\"d\\\"]\\n- Object - You can explain objects like real life objects that are comprised by other datatypes, you can use the analogy with HTML Tags because the tags have properties taht describe them further. Objects behave the same way.\\n\\nNote: Data Types on Breatheco.de: [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types)\\n\\n### String Contatenation\\n\\nSuming two integers its not the same as suming two strings, as web developers we are going to be creating HTML using Javascript, we will contatenate like crazy!\\n\\n### Arrays (no loops yet)\\n\\nSince we just learned what an array is, let\\u2019s look at some basic properties of an array:\\n\\n1. value or item: The value stored on each position.\\n2. index or position: the position of the given value in the array `note: the first position starts at 0`\\n3. length - the total length of the array\\n\\nDeclaring an array [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array#how-to-declare-an-array)\\n\\nTo initialize an array , you can use the following:\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [];\\n```\\nThis defines the array as an empty set so that you can add values later.\\n\\nNote: Don\\u2019t use, use let or const.\\n\\nYou can also initialize an array with a value in it**\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];\\n```\\nDisplaying the value of an array using console, we can show it as `console.log(myArray[0]);`\\n\\nUpdating a specific position: `myArray[4]=3;`\\n\\nGenerating a random number using `Math.rand()`\\n\\n## Start Coding!!

React handles all of that. You will create your own components and tell react what component to render and when; react handles all interaction with DOM on the front end.\\n- Now its all about component based, its a lot easier to re-use your code int he future.\\n- It\\u2019s much faster than traditional javascript. Instead of re-rendering the whole page when a single change occurs, React renders individual items that change. \\n\\n#### You can create your own tags\\n\\n- Before, you learned that HTML Tags are set functions that the browser knows how to interpret.\\n- Now in React, You can create your own tags by creating usable components.\\n- Just create a function that returns HTML and that will become its own tag.\\n- JSX its like HTML+JS you have to get use to it.\\n- You have to use braces in the middle of your HTML to include dynamic JS.\\n```jsx\\nconst Alert = function(props){\\n    return (<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>);\\n}\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>)\\n```\\n- You have to use [proptypes](https:\\/\\/reactjs.org\\/docs\\/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (best practice).\\n```js\\nAlert.propTypes = {\\n  children: PropTypes.node,\\n  \\/\\/ any other property...\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## `1:25 min` Do the React Exercises with the students\\n\\nThe transition to react its hard for the students, that is why we will be doing the react exercises with them.\\n\\n## `60 min before class ends` Start the class project (Landing Page)\\n\\n- This project will be do in groups of two. \\n- Every team must share the same git repository.\\n- Take some time to read the instructions with the students and have them setup they boilerplate and repository.\\n- Each group will strategize privatly how to approach the exercise.\"},{\"id\":18,\"label\":\"Landing Page with React\",\"lessons\":[],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Landing Page with React\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/landing-page-with-react\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"\",\"position\":18,\"assignments\":[\"landing-page-with-react\"],\"description\":\"\",\"key-concepts\":[],\"teacher_instructions\":\"\"},{\"id\":19,\"label\":\"Simple Counter\",\"lessons\":[],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Simple Counter\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/simple-counter-react\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"Students must work on their simple counter.\",\"position\":19,\"assignments\":[\"simple-counter-react\"],\"description\":\"Its the first time you've heard or learn about react, we have given you a lot of exercises to practice.

The world is divided between servers and clients.\\n2. We call \\\"clients\\\" the computers with browsers or mobile apps.\\n3. We call servers where the centralized database is.\\n\\n### HTTP Request vs Response**\\n\\n- The rules used for this client-sever communication is called HTTP, which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.\\n- The way that you get the website is by sending a \\\"Request\\\" to the server. This tells the server what website or resource you are looking to view\\/use. The server then responds with the information.\\n- The server then sends a response, which tells will confirm the receipt of the request and let your computer know that it will begin sending data.\\n- This back and forth process will continue with more Request=>Response pairs until you have finished loading your remote resource.\\n\\n### Everything is text!\\n\\n- With HTTP, it\\u2019s important to focus on the first T in the acronym, which stands for `Text`. In this protocol, everything is sent back and forth as TEXT.\\n- While there are other protocols out there, for now, we want to remember that with HTTP \\u2013 Everything is TEXT.\\n- Make students open a picture with Notepad\\/TextEdit they will see the text that represents the image.\\n\\n### Browser Interpretation\\n\\n- After your browser uses the HTTP protocol and receives the data as text, it then has the job of interpreting that text and converting it to the correct visual format.\\n\\n#### HTML\\n\\n- The first TEXT-based format we will see is HTML.\\n- HTML its all about `<tags>` you open and close tags to give them basic format.\\n- There are a lot of HTML tags but you only have to know a few and you can always google them.\\n    - Explain the basic tags like `<p>`,`<div>`,`<a>`,`<span>`, headings (`<h1>`,`<h2>`,etc).\\n\\n[[demo]]\\n| :point_up: The most important thing to remember in HTML is to ALWAYS BE CLOSING!\\n\\n#### Always Be Closing and Indentation Matters**\\n\\n- Everything is going to be done in blocks of code.\\n- First you open the block, then you close the block.\\n\\n### CSS vs HTML\\n```css\\n#id_selector { property: value; }\\n.class_selector { property: value; }\\ntag_selector { property: value; }\\n```\\n\\n## `20 min` Start the new content: Advanced CSS\\n\\n### Specificity\\n\\n- Do not use ID as CSS selectors (use specificity).\\n- The class selector is the most used because it can be reused all over your website.\\n- Show this [video that explains](https:\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/watch?v=In78mSOHmls) specificity to the class.\\n- Combine selectors to get more specific about which element you are styling\\n- Ask if anyone remembers what we said DRY Programming means? Don\\u2019t repeat yourself.\\nYou may think it\\u2019s funny that they call the opposite of DRY -  WET programming, which they have given the following titles to:  \\\"write everything twice\\\", \\\"we enjoy typing\\\" or \\\"waste everyone's time\\\"**\\n\\n\\n### Box Model\\n\\n- Box layout means that most elements can be thought of as boxes: with margin, padding, with and height.\\n- There are 4 main parts to the typical box model: (draw the following on the board or show picture from breathcode)\\n    - Content: this is what is inside the box\\n    - Padding: this is spacing between the border and content (inside box also)\\n    - Border: this is the edge of the box\\n    - Margin: this is spacing between the outside of the box and the next element over in any direction. (which could be the edge of the page, another div, a paragraph, or even an image)\\n- You can also have a background color or image, this will show in the content area of your box.\\n\\n#### The Display Property:\\n\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline`: Display block its what makes an element behave like a box, inline elements have no margins.\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n- Display: flex; its the main tool for building complex layouts because it easily allows having several divs on the same line (columns).\\n- I recommend going over the CSS and HTML [cheat sheets that we have available on the breathco.de platform under Assets](https:\\/\\/breatheco.de\\/assets\\/).\\n \\n## Display Flex and how important it is.\\n\\nTake some time to explain display:flex and how it is used on today's project.\\n\\n#### The Position Property:\\n\\n- Position:fixed follows the user, it is mainly used for anoying modals or popups.\\n- If one element has position:relative must always be companioned by one or more childs with position:absolute. Its broadly used for relating two elements to each other (one follows the other)\\n- Compare `display:block` vs `display:inline-block`.\\n\\n## `2:30 hr` Start the project!\\n\\nRead the instructions out loud with the class, make sure they understand.\\n\\nStudents must start discussing on the whiteboard a strategy about the project.\\n- From top to bottom identify the tags you will be using.\\n- When to use `display:inline-block` and\\/or `position:absolute` or `position:relative`.\\n- Setup the project with one `index.html` and one `styles.css`\\n\\n## `20 min` Bootstrap\\n\\n### What is bootstrap?\\n\\nJust a predefined stylesheet inveted by [a guy at twitter (Mark Otto)](https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/mdo?lang=en).\\n\\n### Why?\\n\\n- Because doing styles is repetitive, it was about time someone did a boilerplate.\\n- Its component oriented.\\n- It makes websites easier and faster to build.\\n\\n### Bootstrap versions & download\\n\\nBootstrap has many versions, always check if you are using the last version of Bootstrap on your project, here you can find all the available versions: [https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/](https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/versions\\/)\\n\\nWe recomend using a CDN to import bootstrap in your HTML like this one: [https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/](https:\\/\\/www.bootstrapcdn.com\\/)\\n\\n### The Most Important (Used) Components\\n\\n1. Navbar\\n2. Card\\n3. Modal: https:\\/\\/getbootstrap.com\\/docs\\/4.0\\/components\\/modal\\/#live-demo\\n\\n### The Basic Workflow (asuming you have a wireframe or design)\\n\\n1. Build your basic layout with the Grid (container, row and collumns)\\n1. Identify the components you will need (use piece of paper)\\n2. Copy & Paste the component code into your website.\\n3. Customize the component for your specific design.\\n4. Adjust anything else overriding with css styles on your own sylesheet.\\n5. Remember the utility classes to avoid doing to much custom CSS.\\n\\n### Helper\\/Utility Classes that come with bootstrap*\\n\\nThese are classes you can attach that do things such as control margin or padding, control borders, or even float elements.\\nFor example, if you wanted no margin on the left of the element, you can add the class ml-0 to the element and it will set the left margin to zero.\\n\\n### Layout using Grid system\\n\\n- Explain 12 column layout and how it works\\n- every line is a Row\\n- this row holds columns as immediate childs\\n- every Row on a page has 12 columns\\n- columns are equally measured in percentages so they are responsive.\\n- the basic sizes are: col, col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl\\n\\n### Bootstrap does not have fonts or icons\\n\\nWe use google fonts and font awesome for that.\\n\\n## `2:30min` Have class work on bootstrap instagram.\\n\\n- Students gather in pairs tos strategize first (best practice)\\n- Read instructions out loud and have them build a strategy\\n- Have them identify the components.\\n\\nDo not talk more, they will not be able to process it because they are overwhelmed, just help them code.\\n\\nAnswer questions individually with your teacher assistants.\\n\"},{\"id\":2,\"label\":\"HTML Forms\",\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"Understanding HTML Input HTML Text Area and Forms...\",\"slug\":\"html-input-html-textarea\"}],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Create a HTML5 form\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/html5-form\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"\",\"position\":2,\"assignments\":[{\"slug\":\"html5-form\",\"title\":\"Create a HTML5 form\"}],\"description\":\"Forms are the main way to receive inputs from the website user, we use forms every day, and it's worth giving them a whole day focus to understand them properly.\",\"key-concepts\":[\"Forms are the main way to receive data (inputs) from the user\",\"What are form validations\",\"Using max and min on inputs\",\"Using input type=date for dates\",\"Using type=number for numbers\",\"The select (a.k.a dropdown)\",\"Textareas\",\"Radios and checkboxes\",\"Styling a form\"],\"teacher_instructions\":\"Go over forms and why to use them, explain each type of input available and how HTML5 introduced a way to prevent errors using properties like max, min, required,etc. Also focus on how bootstrap allows styling forms and show the bootstrap documentation on forms.\",\"extended_instructions\":\"# HTML Forms\\n\\n## `20 min` About forms\\n\\nThese are the most important things to mention:\\n\\n- Forms are the most important way to receive or ask information to the user.\\n- By default, submitting a form will create a GET or POST request to the server in HTTP, you can specify that on the `<form method=\\\"POST\\\" \\/>` attribute.\\n- GET is for  searching or fetching for information, basically forms that will not result in database update.\\n- POST is for forms that result in database modifications (writing on the db).\\n- What are the most used form elements?

Review the key concepts. Do a live demonstration on how to use Github, branches, resolve conflicts. \",\"extended_instructions\":\"# First time using Git\\n\\nLast class you have introduced GitHub, students must have finish reading and watching videos and building their public profile with YML.\\n\\n### About the GIT authentication:\\n\\nThe academy does not want to explain much about GIT SSH Authentication because it can be a cumbersome concept, for now, we strongly recommend always using HTTP during the course and let students learn about SSH later.\\n\\n### The Commit Object\\n\\nHere is the lesson that talks about that: [https:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#commit-objects](https:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#commit-objects) \\n\\nBasically, a commit is a snapshot (picture) of what your project looked at during the moment of your commit. \\n\\nCommits represent a change in the current code, so if you don\\u2019t have any changes, you will receive a message saying there is nothing to commit.\\n\\nThere are four main parts in a commit:\\n\\n1. Set of files which make up your snapshot at that time\\n2. Instructions pointing to the Parent commit objects\\n3. An SH1 (hash) name that serves as a unique identifier for that specific commit.\\n4. Commits also typically have comments, which should explain what was changed or addressed in the current commit\\n\\n### The HEAD\\n\\nThe heads of the repository are like the \\\"revision history of the project.\\\"  \\n\\nA revision history is a list of commit objects that altogether contain all the changes that you and your other team members have made to the project files.\\n\\nEvery time you make a new commit, the head will move to that new commit.  (This way you are able to have access to the entire project history of commits.)\\n\\nIt is possible to move the head to a different commit, however, you must remember that commits made after the commit to which the head is pointing at are not possible to be reviewed.\\n\\n### The Stage\\n\\nWhen creating a commit, you select which files you wish to add to the commit. This is called \\\"staging\\\" your commit. (basically, preparing your formal commit object)\\n\\nTypically, you will use \\\"git add .\\\" which adds all files to your stage for the current commit, then follow it with your commit.\\n\\n### Branch\\n\\nA branch allows you to work on a specific feature of code without compromising the main code in a repository.  [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/how-to-use-git-version-control-system#a-head-object-is-a-list-of-commits) \\n\\nThat means that each branch is a separate revision history.\\n\\nThe main branch of code in the repository is called \\\"Master\\\" typically\\n\\nYou can have as many different branches as you want in a repository\\/project.\\n\\nEach branch has it\\u2019s own head which resides on the last commit of that branch. So if you have two branches, \\\"Master\\\" and \\u201clogin\\u201d, each will have their own head on the last commit.\\n\\nWhen you are satisfied with the feature you developed, you can merge it back in to master and it will bring all code changes, along with replace the head on master with the new head.\\n\\n### Typical Flow\\n\\n1. All new projects have to be initialized with git.  (git init)\\n    - This creates a git folder with all elements that define the git project.\\n    - At this point, it\\u2019s also good to set the remote for your project. This will tell the project what the address is for your repository so that you can push changes later.\\n\\n 2. the command for this is:  git remote add origin https:\\/\\/github.com\\/user\\/repo.git \\n\\n 3. where the address at the end is your repository address or SSH address.\\n\\n26. Whenever you have to stage your changes, you use \\\"git add\\\". As mentioned before, to add all file changes, \\u201cgit add .\\u201d \\n\\n > Note: conversely, you can condense this into the git commit by adding a flag \\\"-a\\\" which means add all files to the commit stage\\n\\n4. Once you made changes to your code and you are ready to commit: You create a commit object by using \\\"git commit -m \\u2018commit message\\u2019\\\" or if you have not used git add, you can use the -a flag as mentioned before.\\n\\n5. At this point, you want to use \\u2018git push\\u2019 to upload your changes\\n\\n6. If you need to create a new branch:\\n\\n    - git checkout -b [branch name]\\n\\n    - next you need to switch to that branch to work on it\\n\\n        3. git checkout [branch name]\\n\\n    - when you complete your changes on a new branch, you merge the changes back in using the following:\\n\\n        4. git merge [other branch name]\\n\\n\\n## Commit vs PUSH\\n\\nWe already discussed that a commit will allow you to create a new commit object. This is a local bundle you are preparing to upload.\\n\\nWhen you finish your commit, you have to attempt to upload that code to the repository.\\n\\nThis is where git push comes in. It allows you to attempt to upload your changes to the repository.\\n\\nIf there are any issues where a conflict has arisen, you will have to resolve the conflicts before pushing your changes.\\n\\n## Resolving Conflicts\\n\\nFor conflicts, git will notify you that there are issues.\\n\\n- this typically occurs when two people are trying to modify the same file(s).\\n\\nTo proceed you need to:\\n\\n- Get the new changes downloaded to your computer with \\u2018git pull\\u2019 or if you are on a branch, \\u2018git pull origin branch-name\\u2019\\n\\n- Then you will be asked to merge the changes \\n\\n- Here you will have to edit the files with conflicts and resolve any changes. \\n\\n- Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can attempt to push changes again.\\n\\n## Start Coding With The Students!\\n\\n** At this point we will start the assignment for the git collaborative portfolio project.**\\n\\n** Break the class into groups and assign a section of the portfolio project**\\n\\n** [https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg]**(https:\\/\\/github.com\\/breatheco-de\\/exercise-collaborative-html-website\\/blob\\/master\\/website1\\/designs\\/guide.jpg)\\n\\n* Use peer programming to complete the section quickly, then upload the changes to the repository your professor has provided.\\n\\nTeacher will clone the repo in a new class repository and will handle updating the name of the template parts so that the site functions properly.\\n\\n### Students Homework: \\n\\nFinish all pending projects including todays.\"},{\"id\":6,\"label\":\"Intro to JS\",\"lessons\":[{\"title\":\"What is JavaScript?

Stop the class and explain JS concepts when needed.\",\"extended_instructions\":\"# Javascript Variables, DataTypes and Arrays\\n\\nStart anwering any questions students may have.\\n\\n## `20min` Javascript Intro:\\n\\n**Warning**: Please do not explain the DOM or Events, also, don't explain loops or functions yet. Students will be overwhelmed.\\n\\n### Why Javascript?\\n\\nStatic websites are just blog posts, but was about interactive applications like Instagram, Facebook, etc.?\\n\\nJavascript lets us create dynamic HTML and CSS based on user or system interactions, for example:\\n- Adding an `li` to a `ul` when the user clicks on a button.\\n- Showing a banner or ad (publicity) based on the user IP address.\\n- Ask for information to a database.\\n- Write on a database using AJAX.\\n- etc.\\n\\nBasically: Javascript its a programming language to generate HTML and CSS (text) based on events.\\n\\n## The`<script>` tag:\\n\\nAll javascript must be done on a separate sheet (best practice).\\nYou have to import to put that tag **right before the body closing tag**.\\nThe code execution starts on the `window.onload = function(){}` like this:\\n```\\n\\/\\/index.js\\n\\nwindow.onload = function(){\\n    \\/\\/your code here\\n}\\n\\n\\/\\/you can declar other functions here, but please don't write code outside functions\\n```\\n\\n**Warning**: Carefull explaining the windown.onload, because today we are not suppose to overwhelme them with events and functions.\\n\\n### Explain Variables:\\n\\nVariables are javascript\\u2019s version of containers that hold some information.\\n\\nAn example of this is:\\n\\n1. Let\\u2019s say we needed to store someone\\u2019s birthday for an age verification script\\n2. One of our variables might be: `var day = 29;`\\n3. There are three things going on here:\\n    - First, the computer interprets the letters VAR as the beginnig of a variable declaration.\\n    - After `VAR` it must always come the variable name: in our case is called `day`.\\n    - Secondly, we are storing a value of 29 in that variable.\\n    - Finally, notice the syntax. All javascript lines typically end with semicolon. There will be some cases where you don\\u2019t use semicolon and we will learn those later but for now, all lines are with semicolon.\\n\\n3. Given that we defined the var above, `var day = 29;` if we want to display it for testing, we can show use the javascript console:\\n    - Explain how to open the google inspector console\\n    - So to display the variable, you would use: `console.log(day);`\\n    - will print on the console `29`\\n\\n### Data Types\\n\\nYou can store 6 differnt types of values: Strings, Integers, Booleans, Arrays, Objects, Functions, Null and Undefined.\\n\\n- Boolean - true\\/false\\n- String - always in quotes\\n- Number - any type of number -  integer numbers, negative numbers, decimal numbers, floats, etc.\\n- Undefined - nothing was set or specified for the variable. so the variable has no value\\n- Null - When a database or function returns nothing, it returns null\\n- Array - data sets [2,3,4,\\\"cat\\\",242,\\\"d\\\"]\\n- Object - You can explain objects like real life objects that are comprised by other datatypes, you can use the analogy with HTML Tags because the tags have properties taht describe them further. Objects behave the same way.\\n\\nNote: Data Types on Breatheco.de: [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-javascript-learn-to-code-in-javascript#data-types)\\n\\n### String Contatenation\\n\\nSuming two integers its not the same as suming two strings, as web developers we are going to be creating HTML using Javascript, we will contatenate like crazy!\\n\\n### Arrays (no loops yet)\\n\\nSince we just learned what an array is, let\\u2019s look at some basic properties of an array:\\n\\n1. value or item: The value stored on each position.\\n2. index or position: the position of the given value in the array `note: the first position starts at 0`\\n3. length - the total length of the array\\n\\nDeclaring an array [http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array](http:\\/\\/content.breatheco.de\\/lesson\\/what-is-an-array-define-array#how-to-declare-an-array)\\n\\nTo initialize an array , you can use the following:\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [];\\n```\\nThis defines the array as an empty set so that you can add values later.\\n\\nNote: Don\\u2019t use, use let or const.\\n\\nYou can also initialize an array with a value in it**\\n```js\\nlet myArray = [1,2,3,4,5];\\n```\\nDisplaying the value of an array using console, we can show it as `console.log(myArray[0]);`\\n\\nUpdating a specific position: `myArray[4]=3;`\\n\\nGenerating a random number using `Math.rand()`\\n\\n## Start Coding!! Work with the students on the exercises.\\n\\nExplain to the students how they learnpack exercises work:\\n\\nThere are 4 main exercises: Begin JS, Arrays, Functions, and Mastering Javascript, and they are supposed to be done on top of each other because they share the same concepts E.g: You need to know about strings to know about functions because you probably will use a string within a function.\\n\\n1.

In HTTP you can only print text, it can be an HTML Text, CSS Text, JSON Text, Javascript Test.\\n3. Basically it means generating strings dynamically.\\n4.

Instead of re-rendering the whole page when a single change occurs, React renders individual items that change. \\n\\n#### You can create your own tags\\n\\n- Before, you learned that HTML Tags are set functions that the browser knows how to interpret.\\n- Now in React, You can create your own tags by creating usable components.\\n- Just create a function that returns HTML and that will become its own tag.\\n- JSX its like HTML+JS you have to get use to it.\\n- You have to use braces in the middle of your HTML to include dynamic JS.\\n```jsx\\nconst Alert = function(props){\\n    return (<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>);\\n}\\n\\nReactDOM.render(<div className=\\\"any-class-name\\\">{props.children}<\\/div>)\\n```\\n- You have to use [proptypes](https:\\/\\/reactjs.org\\/docs\\/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) (best practice).\\n```js\\nAlert.propTypes = {\\n  children: PropTypes.node,\\n  \\/\\/ any other property...\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## `1:25 min` Do the React Exercises with the students\\n\\nThe transition to react its hard for the students, that is why we will be doing the react exercises with them.\\n\\n## `60 min before class ends` Start the class project (Landing Page)\\n\\n- This project will be do in groups of two. \\n- Every team must share the same git repository.\\n- Take some time to read the instructions with the students and have them setup they boilerplate and repository.\\n- Each group will strategize privatly how to approach the exercise.\"},{\"id\":18,\"label\":\"Landing Page with React\",\"lessons\":[],\"project\":{\"title\":\"Landing Page with React\",\"instructions\":\"https:\\/\\/projects.breatheco.de\\/project\\/landing-page-with-react\"},\"quizzes\":[],\"replits\":[],\"homework\":\"\",\"position\":18,\"assignments\":[{\"slug\":\"landing-page-with-react\",\"title\":\"Landing Page with React\"}],\"description\":\"As a react developer you will be creating landing pages every day, you have already build a couple using HTML\\/CSS and now it's time to build it in React.js\",\"key-concepts\":[],\"teacher_instructions\":\"Make students create their first react components and explain the use of JSX.
