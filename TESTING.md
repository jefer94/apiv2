## Why software testing?

Software that does not work correctly can lead to many problems such as:

- Loss of time
- Loss of effort
- Loss of money
- Loss of business reputation
- Injury or death

Testing helps in ensuring that software work correctly and reduces the risk of software failure, thereby avoiding the problems mentioned above

## Software Testing Goals

The three main goals of Software Testing are:

- Defect detection
- Defect prevention
- User satisfaction

## Type of testing

- Unit testing: this software testing approach is followed by the programmer to test the unit of the program. It helps developers to know whether the individual unit of the code is working properly or not.
- Integration testing: it focuses on the construction and design of the software. You need to see that the integrated units are working without errors or not.
